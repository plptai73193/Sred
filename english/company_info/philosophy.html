                <p>As a member of the Sumitomo Metal Mining Group, Sumiko Resources Exploration &amp; Development Company (SRED) has established the following management philosophy based on Sumitomo's Business Philosophy.</p>
                <ol class="">
                    <li data-num="1.">We will strive to harmoniously coexist with the earth and society based on Sumitomo's Business Philosophy, and, through the implementation of healthy business activities, will contribute to society, fulfill our responsibilities to stakeholders, and be a more trusted company.</li>
                    <li data-num="2.">We will recognize the dignity and value of people, based on respect, and will strive to be a cheerful and energetic company.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This management philosophy will clarify SRED objectives and how to achieve them.
                    <br> A Code of Conduct for Directors and Employees has been established to help achieve our management philosophy.
                </p>
                Our management philosophy states firstly that we will strive to be a more trusted company, and it specifies the following method to achieve that.
                <ol>
                    <li data-num="1)">Work based on Sumitomo's Business Philosophy</li>
                    <li data-num="2)">Harmoniously coexist with the earth and society</li>
                    <li data-num="3)">Implement healthy company activities</li>
                    <li data-num="4)">Contribute to society</li>
                    <li data-num="5)">Fulfill responsibilities to stakeholders (customers, shareholders, employees, creditors, local residents, business partners, citizen groups, government, and other parties concerned)</li>
                </ol>
                Our second objective is to be a cheerful and energetic company, achieved by doing the following.
                <ol>
                    <li data-num="1)">Act based on a respect for people</li>
                    <li data-num="2)">Recognize human dignity and value</li>
                </ol>
                <hr>
                <h3 id="Behavior" class="sct-title">Code of Conduct</h3>
                <p class="m50t">Code of Conduct for Directors and Employees</p>
                <p>In order to achieve the objectives of the Sumiko Resources Exploration &amp; Development Company (SRED) management philosophy, directors and employees must adhere to the Code of Conduct described below.
